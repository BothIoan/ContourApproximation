# ContourApproximation

Some pretty standard contour approximation algorythim in C++ & OpenCV . Works with black & white images. 

## My additions to the standard formula
I took it as an exercice for stuff I want to know better so :

* I did it as modular as possible
* I generalised the steps and applied recursivity .
* I used some macros that decrease the performance of the program XD.
* I used streams and lambda expressions because I like those .
